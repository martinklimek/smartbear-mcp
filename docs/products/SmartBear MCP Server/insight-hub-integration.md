The Insight Hub client provides comprehensive error monitoring and debugging capabilities as listed below. Tools for Insight Hub requires an `INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN`.

If you wish to interact with only one Insight Hub project, we also recommend setting `INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY` to reduce the scope of the conversation. This allows the MCP server to pre-cache your project's custom filters for better filtering prompts.
